Welcome to naplugi's documentation!
===================================

naplugi is a fork of `pluggy <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy>`_ modified
by the `napari <https://github.com/napari/napari>`_ team for use in napari.

While much of the original API described in the `pluggy docs
<https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ will still be valid here, there
are definitely some breaking changes and different conventions here.

If you're just getting started, have a look at the :doc:`usage`
