napari-plugin-engine documentation
==================================

``napari-plugin-engine`` is a fork of `pluggy
<https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy>`_ modified by the `napari
<https://github.com/napari/napari>`_ team for use in napari.

While much of the original API described in the `pluggy docs
<https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ will still be valid here, there
are definitely some breaking changes and different conventions here.

If you're just getting started, have a look at the :doc:`usage`
